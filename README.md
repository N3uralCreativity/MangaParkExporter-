You read your manga on a site (like MangaPark), you have a list of favorites and chapters read, and you don’t want to lose that.  
This app exports your follows + reading progress to **MyAnimeList** or to local files you can reuse later.

## 🚀 How to use (quick version – Windows)

The easiest way is to use the ready-made **.exe** file:

>>>>>>> 60de69b12349fd7f8af64f863741e99474524de7
1. Go to the **latest release** on GitHub 👉 [Lastest Release](https://github.com/N3uralCreativity/MangaParkExporter-/releases/latest)
2. Download the `.exe` file (for example: `MangaParkExporter-X.X.X.exe`).
3. Make sure **Chrome or Edge** is installed on your PC AND you are logged into the site you wish to export data from.
4. Double-click the `.exe`:
   - Choose **Authenticated** if you want to export **your own favorites & progress**.
   - Choose **Public** if you just want a list from public/trending pages.
5. Click **Start Export** and wait until it finishes.
6. Open the generated **XML** (for MAL import) or **HTML** (to browse locally) in the `output/` folder.

No installation, no command line required unless you want it : 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/N3uralCreativity/MangaParkExporter-.git
cd MangaParkExporter-
pip install -r requirements.txt
python desktop_app_v3.py
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Getting started from source (advanced users)

If you prefer running from source instead of using the .exe:

### Run from source

1. Install **Python 3.8+**
2. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MangaParkExporter.git
   cd MangaParkExporter
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Launch:
   ```bash
   python mangapark_gui.py
   ```

### Build a standalone `.exe` (Windows)

```bash
python build_exe.py
```

- The `.exe` will appear in `dist/`
- No Python needed for end users  
- Requires Chrome/Edge installed (for Selenium)

---

## 📖 Basic usage (in the app)

### Authenticated mode (your own follows & progress)

1. Choose **🔒 Authenticated** in the app.  
2. Let the app **auto-fetch cookies** from Chrome  
   - or paste your cookies manually if you prefer.  
3. Click **▶️ Start Export**.  
4. When it finishes, open:
   - The **XML** file (for MAL import).
   - The **HTML** file (to browse your list locally).

### Public mode (no account needed)

1. Choose **🌐 Public**.  
2. Click **▶️ Start Export**.  
3. It scrapes public lists (e.g. trending/popular) and exports them the same way.

---

## 📂 Output

Everything goes into the `output/` folder:

- `mangapark_to_mal.xml` – MAL-compatible export  
- `manga_list.html` – searchable manga list in your browser  

---

## 🛠️ Under the hood (short version)

- **selenium** – drives a browser to load the manga site
- **beautifulsoup4** – parses the HTML
- **requests** – calls the Jikan API
- **browser-cookie3** – grabs cookies from Chrome (or so its supposed to but wtv)
- **tkinter** – provides the GUI

Flow:

1. Scrape your follows and chapter progress from the site.  
2. For each title, query **Jikan API v4** to find the corresponding MAL entry.  
3. Respect basic rate limits.  
4. Generate MAL XML + an HTML library view.

---

## ⚠️ Requirements (for the `.exe` version)

- Windows 10/11  
- Chrome or Edge installed
